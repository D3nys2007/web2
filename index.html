BoredRn will no longer be receiving updates half the links are blocked on there so i have no use for it anymore
The files for the websites are still here so if you put /home after the .ga in the url you will redirected the home page

Im only gonna keep the vpn up now because its much more useful than the website

If you have any questions please email boredrn.support@protonmail.com  (im only gonna check the inbox like once every 3 months or smth so dont expect a fast response)

(You can only send emails with personal accounts not school or work email accounts)
